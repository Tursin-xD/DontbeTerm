DontbeTerm is a multi-tab terminal manager designed specifically for Claude Code. It helps you organize multiple command-line windows into one easy-to-use program. The app supports AI-powered tab names, making it simple to keep track of what each terminal window does without typing long titles yourself.

This program is useful if you work with multiple terminal tasks at the same time. Instead of opening many separate windows, you can use DontbeTerm to group them in one place and give each tab a clear, smart name.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and what to do if they happen:

- **Tabs don’t rename**: Check your internet connection, as AI naming needs to connect to online services.

- **Keyboard shortcuts don’t work**: Make sure DontbeTerm is the active window.

If problems continue, consider checking for updates on the release page or contacting the support team through the GitHub repository.
